# Language and Data Intelligence Laboratory Website

The Language and Data Intelligence Laboratory (LDI) website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. This allows us to easily create and maintain a dynamic website with minimal effort. Moreover, Github Pages natively supports Jekyll, making it easy to deploy the website just by commiting the current folder.

## Build and Deploy Locally

### Testing the website locally with Bundle

After cloning the repository, one may want to run the website locally to see the changes before deploying it to the main repository.
Hopefully, Jekyll got you covered, and you can run the website locally with the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl=""
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:4000/`. (Even though you run the command on a remote dev container.)
If you get any error, you can refer to this page for help: [Github Pages run your Jekyll locally for testing](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)

### Building the static website locally

*This section concerns the local development of the website. If you want to deploy the website to Github Pages, no actions are needed except pushing the changes to the `master` branch.*

In order to build the website, you will need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed.

Execute the following commands to build the website:
```bash
bundle install \
    && bundle exec jekyll build
```

The generated website could be located under `_site/`. That is the folder you will need to deploy.
