# Language and Data Intelligence Laboratory Website

The Language and Data Intelligence Laboratory (LDI) website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. This allows us to easily create and maintain a dynamic website with minimal effort.

## Build and Deploy

In order to build the website, you will need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed.

Execute the following commands to build the website:
```bash
bundle install \
    && bundle exec jekyll build
```

The generated website could be located under `_site/`. That is the folder you will need to deploy.
